# Temporary File Deletion Script

This Python script allows you to delete temporary files from your system. 
It recursively searches through the system's temporary directory and deletes 
any files whose filenames start with the string "tmp".

# Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed on your system

# Usage

1. Clone or download the script from the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Run the script by typing python delete_temp_files.py and pressing Enter.
4. The script will start searching through the system's temporary directory for files whose filenames start with "tmp".
5. Once the script has finished searching, it will display the total size of the deleted files in megabytes, if any files were found and deleted.
6. The script will also display a message indicating if any temporary files were deleted successfully, or if no temporary files were found.

# Acknowledgments

This script was inspired by a Stack Overflow post on deleting multiple files in Python.
